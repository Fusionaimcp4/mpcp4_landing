## How Voxe Works

1. **Capture** – Voxe connects to your website, chat widget, or social channel to capture customer questions instantly.  
2. **Understand** – The system classifies the intent using Fusion AI’s *NeuroSwitch* engine.  
3. **Respond** – For common questions, Voxe pulls verified answers from its AI knowledge base.  
4. **Escalate** – If the question is sensitive or complex, it routes to a human agent with full chat context.  
5. **Learn** – Every interaction improves future responses automatically.

This cycle creates a self-learning support system that grows smarter every day.
