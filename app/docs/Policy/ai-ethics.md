# AI Ethics & Transparency Policy  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Owner:** Chief AI Officer (CAIO) / Data Protection Officer (DPO)  
**Effective Date:** 2025-11-05  
**Review Cycle:** Annual or after release of new AI system  

---

## 1. Purpose
This policy establishes the ethical principles and transparency standards guiding MCP4.ai’s development, deployment, and management of Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems.  
It ensures compliance with **ISO 42001**, **GDPR Art. 22 (automated decision-making)**, **ISO 27701**, and global frameworks like the **EU AI Act** and **NIST AI Risk Management Framework (RMF)**.

---

## 2. Scope
Applies to:  
- All AI models and systems used in **Fusion**, **Voxe**, and **NeuroSwitch**.  
- All stages of the AI lifecycle — design, data sourcing, training, testing, deployment, and monitoring.  
- All MCP4.ai employees, contractors, and third parties involved in AI system development or governance.  

Covers both proprietary models and integrations with external LLMs (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, etc.).

---

## 3. Objectives
1. Ensure AI systems align with ethical values, human rights, and applicable laws.  
2. Promote fairness, accountability, and explainability in AI decision-making.  
3. Maintain transparency and informed user consent for AI interactions.  
4. Prevent harm, bias, and misuse of AI technologies.  
5. Enable continuous oversight, auditing, and improvement of AI behavior.  

---

## 4. Ethical Principles
MCP4.ai’s AI systems operate under the following principles:

### 4.1 Fairness and Non-Discrimination
- AI systems must treat all individuals equitably regardless of race, gender, language, nationality, or belief.  
- Data used in model training must be representative and free from bias.  
- Regular **Bias & Fairness Audits** conducted using ISO 42001-aligned metrics.  

### 4.2 Transparency and Explainability
- Users are clearly informed whenever they interact with an AI system.  
- AI decisions must be explainable in human-understandable terms.  
- Documentation includes **Model Fact Sheets**, **Evaluation Reports**, and **Intended Use Statements**.  
- Any automated or AI-assisted decision includes a human-review mechanism.  

### 4.3 Accountability
- AI ownership and accountability clearly assigned to system owners (CAIO, CISO, or Product Lead).  
- Logs maintained for model inputs, outputs, and decision paths.  
- AI incidents escalated via the **AI Incident Response Procedure**.  

### 4.4 Privacy and Data Protection
- AI systems designed according to **Privacy-by-Design** and **Data Minimization** principles.  
- Personally identifiable information (PII) anonymized or pseudonymized before use in training or inference.  
- Data access limited and monitored under the **Access Control Policy**.  

### 4.5 Safety and Reliability
- Models tested for robustness against adversarial inputs, prompt injection, and output manipulation.  
- All AI models undergo **Pre-Deployment Risk Assessment** and **Post-Deployment Monitoring**.  
- Fail-safes and human oversight mechanisms ensure recovery from malfunction or misuse.  

### 4.6 Human Oversight
- Final accountability for all AI-driven actions remains with MCP4.ai human operators.  
- Human-in-the-loop (HITL) review required for outputs that affect legal, financial, or ethical outcomes.  

### 4.7 Social and Environmental Responsibility
- AI deployments must not enable disinformation, surveillance abuse, or social harm.  
- MCP4.ai supports sustainable computing practices (energy-efficient models, resource monitoring).

## 5. AI Governance Framework
MCP4.ai’s AI governance follows **ISO 42001** structure across five domains:

| Domain | Description | Evidence |
|---------|-------------|----------|
| **Leadership & Accountability** | Assign AI oversight roles (CAIO, Ethics Committee). | AI Oversight Charter |
| **Data & Model Governance** | Control data quality, labeling, and provenance. | Data Audit Reports |
| **Risk & Impact Assessment** | Evaluate technical and ethical risks before deployment. | AI Risk Register |
| **Transparency & Communication** | Disclose AI use and limitations to users. | Public AI Disclosure Page |
| **Continuous Monitoring** | Audit, retrain, and monitor for drift and bias. | Quarterly AI Monitoring Report |

---

## 6. AI Use Disclosure
All user-facing interfaces (e.g., Voxe chatbots, Fusion dashboards) must:
- Clearly identify AI-generated responses (e.g., “AI Assistant Response”).  
- Provide a link to this **AI Ethics & Transparency Policy**.  
- Offer users a contact for human escalation.  
- Avoid manipulative or misleading behavior (no synthetic impersonation).  

---

## 7. Prohibited AI Uses
MCP4.ai explicitly prohibits:
- AI systems that generate or spread disinformation, hate speech, or harassment.  
- Facial recognition or surveillance-based analytics without explicit consent.  
- Use of AI for discriminatory profiling or employment screening.  
- Training on copyrighted or sensitive data without legal rights or user permission.  

---

## 8. Documentation and Explainability
Each deployed AI system must maintain:
- **Model Fact Sheet** (purpose, owner, training data, version, evaluation metrics).  
- **AI Impact Assessment (AIIA)** for high-risk applications.  
- **Model Card** documenting limitations, intended use, and known biases.  
- **AI Audit Log** for traceability of inputs, outputs, and key parameters.  

These artifacts are reviewed by the **AI Ethics Committee** and retained for 3 years.

---

## 9. AI Ethics Committee
MCP4.ai establishes an internal AI Ethics Committee composed of:
- Chief AI Officer (Chair)  
- CISO / DPO  
- Legal & Compliance Officer  
- Product Lead (Fusion, Voxe, or NeuroSwitch)  

**Responsibilities:**  
- Review high-risk AI deployments before approval.  
- Monitor AI incidents and ethical compliance.  
- Recommend retraining or suspension of models with ethical violations.  
- Oversee periodic ethical audits.

---

## 10. User Rights and Transparency
Users have the right to:
- Be informed when interacting with AI.  
- Request explanation of AI-generated outcomes.  
- Opt-out of automated decision-making where applicable.  
- File complaints about AI misuse or harm via **privacy@mcp4.ai**.  

All user rights requests handled under the **Data Subject Rights Policy**.

---

## 11. Training and Awareness
- All engineers, data scientists, and product managers undergo annual AI ethics and compliance training.  
- Training includes fairness, bias mitigation, privacy-by-design, and explainable AI.  
- Completion tracked in the **Training Register** for audit purposes.

---

## 12. Enforcement
Violations of this policy — such as deploying unapproved AI systems or using data without proper authorization — constitute **major compliance breaches**.  
Consequences may include access suspension, disciplinary measures, or termination of vendor relationships.

---

## 13. Continuous Improvement
- AI ethics reviews conducted **quarterly** and after every major model update.  
- Lessons from incidents or audits integrated into the **AI Risk Management Policy**.  
- Policy reviewed annually or when new AI laws (e.g., EU AI Act) take effect.
